# Coding Quiz Challenge

## Description

This project was made to learn about using Javascript to edit html and css properties, as well as how to use local storage. I learned how to Use javascript effectively and how to commit values to local storage correctly.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Start the quiz by clicking the "start" button, then select one of the multiple choice answers to each question until a final score is reached. This quiz goes against a timer that is reduced every time a wrong answer is entered. The highest score will be saved in local storage and read to the page.
